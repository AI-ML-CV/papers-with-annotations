This project compiles multiple (AI-related) papers with illustrations, annotations, and brief explanations of technical keywords, terms and previous studies which makes it easier to read the paper and to get the main idea.

- [object detection papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/tree/master/object-detection)
- [ai and cognitive science related papers with annotations](https://github.com/Machine-Learning-Tokyo/papers-with-annotations/tree/master/ai-and-cognitive-science)

Please feel free to open new PR (pull request) if you have such kind of annotated research papers (related to AI, ML, DL, neuroscience, cognitive sciences). 


Also, please give us a feedback by opening an issue on this repository. We are looking forward for your collaboration!
