This project compiles multiple (AI-related) papers with illustrations, annotations, and brief explanations of technical keywords, terms and previous studies which makes it easy to read the paper and follow the main idea.


Please feel free to open new PR (pull request) if you have such kind of annotated research papers (related to AI/ML/DL/Neuroscience). 


Also, please give us a feedback by opening an issue on this repository. We are looking forward for your collaboration.
